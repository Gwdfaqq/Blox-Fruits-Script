## ✅ Top Features of a Good Blox Fruits Script (2025 Edition)

When choosing a Blox Fruits script, make sure it includes the following:

### 1. 💪 Auto Farm (Fastest XP)
An effective auto farm script should support:
- **Melee, Sword, Gun, and Fruit farming**
- **Island/Area selection** for specific farming zones
- **Safe Mode** to avoid bans while farming

### 2. 🗺️ Teleport System
Jump between islands or to bosses instantly. A good teleport feature will:
- Save hours of sailing time
- Let you complete quests faster
- Help dodge enemies in PvP zones

### 3. 🧠 Auto Quest / Auto Equip
Automatically picks quests, equips weapons, and selects the best targets based on your current level. This is ideal for passive grinding.

### 4. ⚔️ Boss Finder + Auto Kill
The script detects bosses on spawn and either teleports you to them or automatically attacks until defeated.

### 5. 🍎 Devil Fruit Sniper + ESP
Tracks rare fruits across the map. Some scripts even **auto-equip and eat fruits**, or store them in your inventory.
